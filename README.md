# Overview

I created a cloud backed database to record a simple to-do list along with a GUI made in python. The primary purpose of this project was to practice utilizing cloud databases in my programs for easy saving and secure data management. I also practiced the creation of basic GUIs to stray from the less appealing terminal based UIs.

# Cloud Database

I used a google firestore database structured with one collection (the list of items), a document for each item, with 3 unique fields describing the item, due date, and completion status. 

# Development Environment

I completed this project in VScode with the python language. I used the firebase library to interact with my database, and the tkinter library in order to build the GUI.

# Future Work

- Improve buttons to interact directly with each individual task rather than a master button.
- Redesign GUI 
- Change the way the tasks refresh on a individual basis rather than re-writing the entire list
